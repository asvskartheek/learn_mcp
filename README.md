# Learn MCP
This repository contains my personal notes of learning MCPs.

## Notes
### Implement the server in Quickstart
You need to add to have the server running, without the server running you cannot run inspector
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    server.run()
```
----------------
Command for running inspector
```
mcp dev server.py
```
-----------
- When URI has a parameter, it will be registered as a template resource
    ```
    resource://{param}
    ```
- All resources must have URI not name
## Questions ü§î

### Transport Types (STDIO vs SSE) üîÑ
*Note: Maybe [MCP Transports documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports) has answers for this*

- [ ] STDIO (Standard Input/Output)
    - How does it handle communication?
    - Use cases and limitations
- [ ] SSE (Server-Sent Events)
    - Benefits and drawbacks
    - Implementation differences
---

### Inspector Command Details üîç
- [ ] Understanding the command:
    ```
    uv run --with mcp mcp run server.py
    ```
---

### MCP Protocol Features üì°
- [ ] Ping functionality
    - Purpose and implementation
- [ ] Sampling
    - What is it?
- [ ] Roots
    - What is it?
